- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    - Class components are used for a good amount of purposes over function: but mostly when you want to use state or store anything in state. 

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    - Render - handles all of the rendering inside of your component
    - componentWillUnmount - called right when a lifecycle method is about to finish to clean up what ever you want to clean up
    - ComponentDIdmount - Used to update the DOM as the state changes

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    - You can make your app super lean by combining multiple actions into one custom hook that you can reuse across multiple functions. No need for Bloat functions this way ( I want to get a lot better at writing custom hooks!)

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

    - Ensures debugging before deploying
    - Forces you to write cleaner/ more efficient code
    - prevents having to manually debug later on
    - creates documentation
    - looks cool 8)
